This repo is for my learning exercise in creating a standalone tic-tac-toe game in Electron.

To run, use the command "npm start".

To build on Windows:
    1. Run "npm install" to download project dependencies for building distributable.
    2. Run "npm run distWin".
    3. Locate distributable in the "dist" project folder that is generated during the package process.
    4. Double click the "tic-tac-toe Setup X.X.X.exe" program.

To build on Mac:
    1. Run "npm install" to download project dependencies for building distributable.
    2. Run "npm run distMac".
    3. Locate distributable in the "dist" project folder that is generated during the package process.
    4. Double click the "tic-tac-toe Setup X.X.X.app" program.
